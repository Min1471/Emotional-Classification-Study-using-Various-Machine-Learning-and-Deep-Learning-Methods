# Emotional-Classification-Study-using-Various-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-Methods
## Introduction
  This study focuses on emotion classification in tweets, a significant task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The goal of our project is to perform text classification using advanced artificial intelligence algorithms to accurately label tweets with the emotions expressed by their authors, aiming to achieve increased performance on relevant metrics. Our research investigates and compares various approaches to this task. We evaluate the effectiveness of traditional machine learning methods, such as Logistic Regression and Na√Øve Bayes, against more advanced deep learning architectures. These include Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), transformer-based models like BERT, and a more complex model (BERT+BILSTM). By implementing and assessing these diverse AI techniques, we aim to identify the most effective methods for correctly labeling the emotional content of tweets.

## Motivation
The motivation for this project stems from a keen interest in exploring the capabilities and limitations of various machine learning and deep learning approaches in the context of emotion classification in tweets. Our research focuses on comparing traditional machine learning methods with advanced deep learning architectures. The primary motivations are:

  1. Exploration of Traditional vs. Advanced Models: There is a strong interest in examining the performance of traditional machine learning methods, which, despite their simplicity and interpretability, may lack the capacity to capture complex emotional nuances in short text. This is contrasted with the potential of advanced deep learning models to understand context and subtle linguistic cues. The purpose of this comparison is to determine the impact of fundamentally different modeling approaches on the efficiency of emotion classification in tweets.

  2. Understanding the principle of Artificial intelligence: Concept of using artificial intelligence to classify emotions are common area that many engineer want to study and create a model that can capture that essences. By conducting this project is the understand why the AIs are capable of doing this abstract yet complex task. (unsure please help add more)

## Problem Statement
  Our project involves different problems, each representing a key stage in our research into emotional prediction models:

  1. **Which dataset to choose?**: This project is based on the EMOTION dataset, but there are two sub-datasets of this dataset, which are "split dataset(20_000 samples)" and "unsplit dataset(416_809 samples)" 

  2. **How to preprecessing the dataset?**: Analyse the features of the dataset and do some corresponding preprecessing (such as considering which words to stop).

  3. **Which embeddind method to choose?**: We can not compare some different models use different embedding methods, so we need to choose one optimal embeddind method for most of our models

  4. **Choose different models and the optimal parameters for each models**: We need to choose some maching learning, deep learning and transformer models, and choose the optimal parameters for each models.

  5. **How to compare the results of different models?**: Which metric should we compare, which graphs or other visualizations to use, what additional test should we take?

  6. **What conclusions can we draw from comparing the results of different models?**
  7. **Consider what the remaining issues are and what to do next**
